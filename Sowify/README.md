#  Sowify - Serial Over Wi-Fy v_1.0.0
##Project Description:

1. Usage

The app was designed to be used on a resarch vessel where serial communication is used a lot and you need to troubleshoot ocassionally for a missing or distrubed signal. By having the app on your phone or iPad, and a battery-powered Raspberry Pi device you can easily read signals and receive them anywhere on the vessel. 

The application uses MQTT communication to receive serial data over the local network read by a Raspberry Pi device and communicate with it by sending commands and receiving feedback

MQTT communication is easy and effective way to transmit any kind of data from a physical device to an iPhone or iPad over the network thus avoiding lots of cabling and connections that may additionaly over-complicate the process. 

It is to be used specifically for that purpose. Unless you have the controller with the proper setup the app is useless. The setup and the code for the RPi script can be found in a separate section if anybody is interested

2. Install & Run

The project is in beta-testing state @ the moment and can't be downloaded from the AppStore. However it can be cloned from GitHub and installed on a personal device.

3. Credits - packages and sources of information that I have used in my project

- CocoaMQTT
- IQKeyboardManagerSwift
- SwiftTooltipKit
- other sources of information like GitHub, Stack Overflow or similar websites

4. What's next?

The whole setup - the app + the RPi will be throughly tested and improved before it is submitted to the app store. All improvements and changes will be noted in the Release notes section and kept upt to date
